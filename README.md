# File Encryption ðŸ”’
This project involves scrambling a file's binary code, so that only the people who can crack code with the key can open the original file.

# Opening the Original File
The file that will be encrypted is called plainText. When we open the plainText file, it is is a beautiful image of a wolf.

This is the wolf file read in binary mode.

I want to encrypt this file so that no one is allowed to see the wolf unless they have the key. 

# Encrypting the File
This is the"secret" key which means that in encrypted file, 24 = 0, 68 = 1, 153 = 3, 216 = 4  ...

This is called a permutation encryption scheme.

With the power of coding, I mapped the plainText to the key, creating a Cipher Text.
The file is no longer a wolf, try cracking this code without the key!

# Decrypting the File
Since I have the  "secret" key file, I can map the cipherText back to to the key and see the image again.
